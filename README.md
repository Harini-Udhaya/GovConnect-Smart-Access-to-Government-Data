# ⚡ GovConnect — AI Policy Helpdesk

A **full-stack AI-powered policy assistant** that enables government employees to query official documents using **semantic search + LLM intelligence**.

🧠 No keyword matching. Only context-aware answers.
## 🤖 About the Project

GovConnect is an AI-powered policy helpdesk that uses a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) architecture.
It retrieves relevant information from uploaded government documents using semantic search (FAISS + embeddings) and generates accurate answers using an LLM (Groq).
This ensures responses are grounded strictly in official documents, avoiding hallucinations.

## ✨ Key Features

- 🔍 **Semantic Search (FAISS)** — understands meaning, not keywords  
- 🤖 **AI-Powered Answers (Groq LLM)** — accurate & context-based  
- 📄 **PDF Document Support** — upload multiple policy files  
- 🔗 **Source Transparency** — shows exact document references  
- 🎯 **Hallucination Control** — answers only from documents  
- ⚡ **Fast & Lightweight** — fully local embeddings + free API  

## 🖥️ Demo Preview

## 🌐 Live Deployment

- Frontend (Vercel): https://govconnect-helpdesk-chatbot.vercel.app/ 
- Backend (Render): https://govconnect-backend-5jf3.onrender.com
⚠️ Note:
> The backend is deployed on Render (free tier), which may go into a sleep state after inactivity.
> As a result, the first request can take 30–60 seconds due to cold start.
> For demonstration purposes, the application can also be run locally for faster performance.
